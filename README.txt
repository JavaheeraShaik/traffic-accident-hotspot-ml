Project: Traffic Accident Hotspot Prediction + Breast Cancer Classification
==============================

1. Project Structure:
---------------------
The code is organized in Jupyter notebooks:
- Project_Phase4.ipynb : Main notebook for traffic accident hotspot prediction
- breast_cancer_analysis.ipynb : Secondary notebook for cancer classification (2nd domain)

Both notebooks include:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- SMOTE for class balancing (if needed)
- Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Clustering (for traffic data)
- Visualizations and feature importance

2. How to Run:
--------------
For each notebook, run all cells sequentially in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
If using Colab, upload data files and restart runtime after pip installs.

Example:
$ jupyter notebook Project_Phase4.ipynb

---------------------------
- Python 3.10+
- pandas >= 1.5
- numpy >= 1.23
